# BASIC-DRONE-
To build a drone with Arduino, you will need the following:

An Arduino board, such as the Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega.

Motors and propellers. You will need four motors and propellers, one for each corner of the drone.

Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) for the motors. These are used to control the speed and direction of the motors.

A frame for the drone. This can be made from a variety of materials, such as plastic, wood, or metal.

Batteries for powering the motors and the Arduino board.

Wires and connectors for connecting the motors, ESCs, and Arduino board.

To build the drone, follow these steps:

Assemble the frame for the drone. This can be done by attaching the motors and propellers to the corners of the frame.

Connect the motors to the ESCs, and the ESCs to the Arduino board.

Connect the batteries to the Arduino board and the ESCs.

Write a program for the Arduino board that will control the motors and the drone's flight.

Upload the program to the Arduino board, and test the drone to make sure it flies correctly.

By following these steps, you can build a simple drone using Arduino.
